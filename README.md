# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This analysis was prepared to provide insight on fundraising campaign performance. A dataset from Kickstarter has been analyzed to determine how the play 'Fever' compares to other campaigns, broken down by launch dates and funding goals. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to reveal campaign insight and inform on results of "Fever" campaign in order to deliver more effective results for future efforts.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
  - Plays can be successful at any time of year, but May and June show the highest likelihood of success. Campaigns launched in January show the highest likelihood of being cancelled. The failure rate is highest in the fourth quarter of the year, with December specifically being the most common month for failure. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 
  -  Most campaigns are seeking $1,000 to $5,000 in funding & 85% of campaigns are seeking less than $10,000. A ~74% success rate can be assumed when looking for less than $5,000 and a 55% success rate when seeking between $5,000 and $15,000. Sucess rate generally declines the higher the goal though there have been successful campaigns at all goal amounts except for $45,000 - $50,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  -  The dataset does not provide context to a campaign's outcome. There may be unique reasons why a campaign was successful, failed, or cancelled but we cannot account for that in our analysis due to the limitations of the dataset. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - We could analyze the deadline date and the number of backers. For the deadline date, we could look at how many days were allowed to raise money to the goal. The insight for this would be to reveal if campaigns with larger time horizons were more successful than campaigns attempting to raise money quickly. For the number of backers, we could determine if there was coorelation between the number of backers and success rate. The purpose of doign this would be to allow Louise to know if it is better to focus on finding as many backers as possible or to focus on potential high-impact backers.
