# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This analysis was prepared to provide insight on fundraising campaign performance. A dataset from Kickstarter has been analyzed to determine how the play 'Fever' compares to other campaigns, broken down by launch dates and funding goals. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to reveal campaign insight and inform on results of "Fever" campaign in order to deliver more effective results for future efforts.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
  - Plays can be successful at any time of year, but May and June show the highest likelihood of success. Campaigns launched in January show the highest likelihood of being cancelled. The failure rate is highest in the fourth quarter of the year, with December specifically being the most common month for failure. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? Most campaigns are seeking $1,000 to $5,000 in funding. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
